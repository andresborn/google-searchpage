Clone of a google search page for "the odin project." This is the difficult version of this first project in the TOP curriculum. Did the basic HTML, did some CSS. Copied the search bar from first project, aranged the nav-bar, organized the text and margins of the main search results. I still have to arrange columns for the first result and a box for the questions. Will return to this project later, when I have learned some more.
